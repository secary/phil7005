# Assignment 2. PHIL 7005. Due 2 December.

You have two options here. If you really want to write on another topic and have a well worked out plan then please discuss with me.

## Option 1.  A 2000 word assignment on the following topic.

How should we explain the performance of AI systems on tasks designed to probe the nature of human psychology? 

Your answer should discuss at least 2 of the psychological capacities we covered in weeks 7-11. i.e. Language,Theory of Mind, Reasoning. Emotion, Self Awareness.

This is an essay question so clarity of structure is important. It must be organised as a coherent argument to a conclusion. I am looking for evidence that you have understood and can apply the ideas. Imagine that you are teaching the topic to a third year undergraduate and trying to explain your conclusion in a way that both gets across the necessary information, supports your argument, and shows awareness of and ability to deal with alternative arguments.

Clearly every key term needs clear definition and evidential or argumentative support.

## Option 2. Same structure as first assignment. i.e. 4 questions each approximately 500 words.

1. Can LLMs be self aware? What, if anything would be the difference between Turing self awareness and real self awareness. Does the nature of cognitive architecture make a difference to this issue? Why?

2. Does the performance of AI systems on so called Theory of Mind tasks suggest that they understand other minds?

3. Do LLMs understand grammatical concepts?

4. Can a disembodied system be genuinely intelligent? Why or why not?
